The configure file (labeled configure, NOT configure.txt) contains all of the info about what needs to happen to the runs. 

It can be modified on the fly to add info (if you want to add thermo or solvent, or HFX resample). 

If the geo_check:oct is in the configure file, then jobs that are completed are checked for good geometries before spawning any derivative jobs.

If job_recovery is not desired, that line should not be there. 

The folder hierarchy is as follows:
    base_directory
        |----configure
        |----unique_name1
        |----unique_name2
        |----unique_name3
                |----unique_name3.in
                |----unique_name3.xyz
                |----unique_name3_jobscript


The configure file can live within subdirectories, if derivative jobs are only necessary for a subset of jobs.

Job manager reads the configure at the job run time as well as the root directory.

Must be in the directory of the configure, and then call jobmanager/resub.py -- this will follow the configure file and execute on the working tree as described above.

If loading the module (in a python script), do the following:

import jobmanager.resub as resub
resub.main()

The job manager uses the unique name as a queue identifier. Thus, it will not submit a job with a specific unique name, if that unique name is already in the queue. This will prevent the same job from being resubmitted while it is still running. 

Killing the job manager by using ctrl-c should be ok to stop the manager from running. By default, it cycles with a sleep period of 2 hr.
